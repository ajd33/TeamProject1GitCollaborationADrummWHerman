# Team Project 1 - Git Collaboration

* Team Members: Andrew Drumm and William Herman

For this mini-project, you need to find at least one partner to make a team of 2-3 people.  In this group, you need to create a single repository and elect one person to merge pull requests as the team leader.  You must have at least 10 substantive commits per group member that are marked "feature".  Any fixes to "features" must be marked as fixes and do not count.  Commits for creating files or renaming files or other non-feature work should be named "task".

Commit message Examples:
Feature:  Added definition of the term repository.

Fix: Updated definition of repository

Task: Uploaded an image screenshot for a repository
