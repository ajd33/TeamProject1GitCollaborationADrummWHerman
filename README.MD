# Team Project 1 - Git Collaboration

* Team Members: Andrew Drumm and William Herman

For this mini-project, you need to find at least one partner to make a team of 2-3 people.  In this group, you need to create a single repository and elect one person to merge pull requests as the team leader.  You must have at least 10 substantive commits per group member that are marked "feature".  Any fixes to "features" must be marked as fixes and do not count.  Commits for creating files or renaming files or other non-feature work should be named "task".

Commit message Examples:
Feature:  Added definition of the term repository.

Fix: Updated definition of repository

Task: Uploaded an image screenshot for a repository

Formating and style:

1.  Use separate pages as necessary, don't mix the sections up, use one or more pages.
2.  The Readme file should show your group member's name
3.  The Readme file should be an index to your other pages and link to them.
4.  Use markdown (Links to an external site.) to style the pages nicely with headings, bullet points, multiple pages linked together. and pictures.

5.  Put a "Changelog" on your readme files that you list all of the changes to the document and who did them.

6.  Put a section of sources with links to tutorials and feel free to link to other documents in your work.

To complete the assignment, your group needs to submit a link to a Github repository.

1.  50 Points for completing at least 10 feature commits correctly

2.  25 Points for having quality well thought out content that is easy to read.

3.  25 Points using code tags, images, and formatting the content nicely.

Everybody should submit the link in Canvas ( if you are in a group, submit the same link as your partner)
